## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Virtual Environment Setup

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies for each project.

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**

    ```bash
    python -m venv codsoft-env
    ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        codsoft-env\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source codsoft-env/bin/activate
        ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

    Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Each project may have its own `requirements.txt` file. Create one if it doesn't exist by listing all necessary packages.

### Running the Applications

To run any of the applications, navigate to the respective directory and execute the main Python script:

```bash
cd <project-directory>
python main.py
